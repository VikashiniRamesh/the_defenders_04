FARM INPUT CALCULATION:

----SUMMARY----

We are developing an interface to help the farmers with the best possible outcome to suite their requirements in case of crop diseases. Here we are creating application using Java.
In this application we are getting input from the farmer regarding the type of crop affected by disease and area of the land and retrieving the required data using file handling .
Using the information , we suggest the type of pesticide/fertilizer and calculate the amount of pesticide for that crop and display.

----REQUIREMENTS----

No special requirements are needed.

-----GETTING STARTED----

Here, we create an user interface in a simple way so that that couble be feasibly used by the farmers to get to know about their requirement.Initially we come up with storing the basic
data that are needed.Then we will request the user to choose what is the problem they are facing in crop cultivation.

Step 1:We will collect the informations such as Name of the crop, number of days since it has been after cultivation, Area of land which the farmer holds.
Step 2:Then he will be asked to choose the problem that he faces, whether to increase harvest or to get a solution for pests.
Step 3:Based on the data collected and problem selected, solution will be provided with the correct fertilizer or pesticide to be used in appropriate quantity.
 
Then we will provide the solution for their crisis based on the data that has been provided by them. A set of outputs will be displayed based on which they can choose to have a better
crop harvesting.
